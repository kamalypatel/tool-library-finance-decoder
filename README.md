# How to User the MyTurn Finance Decoder

This script is designed run on the financial report export within the lending software MyTurn that many Tool Libraries utilize.

This script was developed with the workflow for the Buffalo Tool Library:
1. Export the data from MyTurn.
2. Rename the export to "Start" and change the file type to "xlsx".
3. Open the Python Script and choose the folder to run the script within. This is done inside your IDE.
4. Then change the number of rows the script needs to run on within the Python Script.
5. Then run the script.
6. A file titled "End.xlsx" will be generated.

This "End.xlsx" file won't be complete but will have 95% of the answers rather than doing it manually. Then you'll need to go to the original export to manually extract the missing data.

We've designed this script to work for our accounting practices within QuickBooks Online.

Your Tool Library may be tracking financials differently than the Buffalo Tool Library so the script may need some changes depending on your financial architecture.
